# Financial Engineering Projects - Group 16
This repository contains a series of assignments for the Financial Engineering course (2023-2024) developed by Group 16. The projects cover a wide range of topics related to financial derivatives, pricing models, and numerical methods. Below is a summary of the key topics covered in each assignment.

### Assignment 1: Option Pricing and Error Analysis

- European Call Option Pricing: Computed using Blackâ€™s formula, CRR binomial tree, and Monte Carlo (MC) methods.
- Error Rescaling: Evaluated the error in pricing using different methods and found optimal parameters for accuracy.
- Exotic Options: Pricing of a Knock-In Call option using closed-form solutions, CRR, and MC methods.
- Vega Sensitivity: Analyzed Vega for different options, comparing numerical and analytical results.
- Bermudan Option Pricing: Applied the CRR method to price a Bermudan option, and studied its behavior compared to vanilla European options.
- Monte Carlo Enhancements: Used antithetic variables to reduce variance in Monte Carlo simulations.
  
### Assignment 2: Yield Curves and Sensitivities

- Bootstrap Yield Curve Construction: Developed a discount factor curve and zero rates using market data, including deposits, futures, and swaps.
- Sensitivity Analysis: Computed DV01, BPV, and duration for interest rate swaps, analyzing the exposure of a portfolio to interest rate shifts.
- Theoretical Exercises: Derived bond pricing models and explored the Garman-Kohlhagen formula for European call options with time-dependent rates and volatility.
  
### Assignment 3: Asset Swaps, CDS, and Python Time-Series Analysis

- Asset Swap Spread: Calculated the Asset Swap Spread over Euribor 3m using market data.
- CDS Bootstrap: Constructed a CDS curve for various obligors (e.g., Intesa Sanpaolo) using bootstrapping and spline interpolation.
- First-to-Default Pricing: Priced a First-to-Default (FtD) contract between two obligors using the Li model and Monte Carlo simulations.
- Python Time-Series Analysis: Implemented basic time-series analysis in Python, including plotting log-returns and performing regression analysis.
